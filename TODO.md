# TODO

Create Api Key, and decide how it is going to be used.

Create each of the following model/controller/service/repos:

- Section: updated manually via POSTs to the controller
- Project: updated manually via POSTs to the controller
- Activity: updated via POSTs to the controller, but I want to somehow automate this. Is there a way to hook into:
  - LinkedIn posts / edits?
  - FaceBook posts?
  - GitHub pushes / pull requests?
